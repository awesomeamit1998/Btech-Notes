Fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and electromagnetic theory are all modeled by partial differential equations and all have plenty of real life applications.

For example,

    Fluid mechanics is used to understand how the circulatory system works, how to get rockets and planes to fly, and even to some extent how the weather behaves.
    Heat and mass transfer is used to understand how drug delivery devices work, how kidney dialysis works, and how to control heat for temperatute-sensitive things. It probably also explains why thermoses work!
    Electromagnetism is used for all electricity out there, and everything that involves light at all, from X rays to pulse oximetry and laser pointers.

You can certainly weakly understand these things to an extent without partial differential equations(PDEs), but understanding the partial differential equations allows a much better understanding and much broader applications (since the PDEs generalize the concepts across time and space more than the non-PDE simplifications).
