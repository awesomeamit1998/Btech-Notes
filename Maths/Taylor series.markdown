The Taylor Series is used in power flow analysis of electrical power systems (Newton-Raphson method).
We can also use Taylor series to approximate integrals that are impossible with the other integration techniques.

A classic example is âˆ«sin(x2)dx

.

We can't actually integrate this, but using the taylor series for sin(x)
we can substitute x2 in for x at each term of the series, and then integrate each term individually. After doing so, we can write a new sum.
Say you were navigating or orienteering and had plenty of time: One could use the law of sines (and the Taylor series) to evaluate lengths of triangles on maps ( SineA/A = SineB/B = SineC/C). Thus distances could be done with incredible accuracy. Three terms of the series would be plenty. It allows you to calculate sine without a calculator. This is obviously a little ridiculous but ever so slightly useful. If you you didn't have paper you could compute in the sand!
